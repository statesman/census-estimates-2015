# Census population estimates, 2015

A one-page viz displaying results from MSA- and county-level Census estimates as of July 1, 2015.

This is part a "Census project" intitiative that will pull together some of our census work.

[`census-home`](https://github.com/statesman/census-home/) is the planned repo to pull them together.

This README is a bit sparse, as we're just republishing this project to a new location.
